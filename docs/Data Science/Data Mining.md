# Data Mining Quick Intro Cheat Sheet

## Definition:
- **Data Mining**: Extracting valuable information from large datasets. Used across various industries for informed decision-making.

## Key Components:
1. **Setting Objectives**: 
   - Collaboration between data scientists and business stakeholders.
   - Define the specific business problem for data mining.

2. **Data Preparation**: 
   - Select relevant data sets.
   - Clean data by removing duplicates, missing values, outliers.

3. **Applying Data Mining Algorithms**: 
   - Search for interesting data relationships.
   - Utilize deep learning techniques.

4. **Evaluating Results**: 
   - Interpret results that are valid, novel, useful, and understandable.

## Common Data Mining Techniques:
1. **Association**: 
   - Rule-based method to find relationships in data.
   - Example: Identify buying habits (e.g., buying cream and strawberries together).

2. **Classification**: 
   - Describe attributes to categorize objects.
   - Example: Classify cars as sedan, 4x4, convertible based on attributes.

3. **Clustering**: 
   - Group pieces of data to form structures based on similarities.

4. **Deep Learning & Predictive Analysis**: 
   - Use artificial neural networks for predictions.
   - Apply regression for labeled data, clustering for unlabeled data.
   - For unlabeled data, usualy clustering the datapoints based upon shared characteristics is considered, However youâ€™ll often see things like decision trees and K Nearest Neighbor, or KNN algorithms, used here.

## Key Takeaways:
- Data mining helps in predicting future trends and identifying unseen relationships.
- Techniques vary in effectiveness based on data and business questions.
- Involves trial and error to find the most effective method.
- Collaboration between business stakeholders and data scientists is key.

## Conclusion:
- Data mining can uncover transformative insights for businesses.
- It's akin to finding gold nuggets in vast datasets.
